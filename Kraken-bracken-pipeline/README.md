# Kraken-Bracken Pipeline

Metatranscriptomics (RNA) data analysis pipeline using kraken for OTU detection and bracken for correction of detected abundance values.

## Input

There are some important inputs that are requested and other inputs and options that have a default value, which can also be modified. 
You can check all of these parameters by using the --help command of the pipeline.  

All inputs and options can be modified either from the command line or directly by changing their default value in the nextflow.config file. 
To modify them from the command line you have to type `--"name of the variable" "desired value"` right after the execution command.  

### reads  
Location where your input fastq files are. Example:  

```--reads '/path/to/reads/*.{1,2}.fastq.gz' ```

The name of the path must be **enclosed in quotes** and it must contain at least **one '*'** wildcard character, in order to catch all samples required.  

It is possible to specify whether the reads are paired or not (parameter pairedEnd). 
If they are paired, it is necessary to use **{1,2}** notation to specify read pairs.  

### krakendb  
Path to Kraken database. This database should be downloaded and built before executing this pipeline, however, 
there is no need for a specific database to perform.

Nevertheless, it is important to reserve enough memory to load the chosen database. The default memory to load the database is 5 GB, but it 
can be tuned by changing the parameter "kraken_mem".  

### targets

A tab-separated values file that contains the names and condition of every sample in our study. An example of the format of this file is the following:

| Filename |     Name     | Type | Covariable |
|:--------:|:------------:|:----:|:----------:|
| GSMXXXX1 | ConditionA 1 |   A  |    Male    |
| GSMXXXX2 | ConditionA 2 |   A  |   Female   |
| GSMXXXX3 | ConditionB 1 |   B  |   Female   |
  
It is required that the third column contains the condition that will be compared in the differential abundance analysis. 
It is also possible (but optional), to add a 4th column that corresponds to a determined covariable to be fitted in the model (in this example, the sex variable).

### contrast

A text file where every line correspond to a contrast to make in the differential abundance analysis. 
The format of writting down the contrast is the following one:  

**Name_of_contrast = (CaseCondition - ControlCondition)**  

It is worth to mention that the first line must contain no contrast and some word such as "Name" or "Contrasts".


## Output

The main output obtained from this pipeline is a file with the extension ".tab" that contains the abundance of each OTU detected in each sample, 
and other file with the extension ".tsv" that contains the names of the different OTUs detected. Krona plots are also obtained (if skip_krona=false)
in a unique directory called "krona_reports"

Additionally, if differential abundance analysis is performed, a file with differentially abundant OTUs with some interest statistics (logFC, 
p-value, etc.) will be obtained, as well as different clustering plots of the different samples in the experiment(in a unique pdf file).
